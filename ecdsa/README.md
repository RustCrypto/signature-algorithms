Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) as specified in
[FIPS 186-4][1] (Digital Signature Standard).

This crate doesn't contain an implementation of ECDSA itself, but instead
contains [`ecdsa::Asn1Signature`][2] and [`ecdsa::FixedSignature`][3] types
generic over an [`ecdsa::Curve`][4] type which other crates can use in
conjunction with the [`signature::Signer`][5] and [`signature::Verifier`][6]
traits.

These traits allow crates which produce and consume ECDSA signatures
to be written abstractly in such a way that different signer/verifier
providers can be plugged in, enabling support for using different
ECDSA implementations, including HSMs or Cloud KMS services.
